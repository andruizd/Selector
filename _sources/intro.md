## Why QC-Selector?

Selecting diverse and representative subsets is crucial for the data-driven models and machine
learning applications in many science and engineering disciplines, especially for molecular design
and drug discovery. Motivated by this, we develop the Selector package, a free and open-source Python library for selecting diverse subsets.

The Selector library implements a range of existing algorithms for subset sampling based on the
distance between and similarity of samples, as well as tools based on spatial partitioning. In
addition, it includes seven diversity measures for quantifying the diversity of a given set. We also
implemented various mathematical formulations to convert similarities into dissimilarities.
