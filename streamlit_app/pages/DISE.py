description = """
    In a nutshell, this algorithm iteratively excludes any sample within a given radius from
    any already selected sample. The radius of the exclusion sphere is an adjustable parameter.
    Compared to Sphere Exclusion algorithm, the Directed Sphere Exclusion algorithm achieves a
    more evenly distributed subset selection by abandoning the random selection approach and
    instead imposing a directed selection.

    Reference sample is chosen based on the `ref_index`, which is excluded from the selected
    subset. All samples are sorted (ascending order) based on their Minkowski p-norm distance
    from the reference sample. Looping through sorted samples, the sample is selected if it is
    not already excluded. If selected, all its neighboring samples within a sphere of radius r
    (i.e., exclusion sphere) are excluded from being selected. When the selected number of points
    is greater than specified subset `size`, the selection process terminates. The `r0` is used
    as the initial radius of exclusion sphere, however, it is optimized to select the desired
    number of samples.
