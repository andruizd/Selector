description = """
    Whereas the goal of the MaxMin algorithm is to maximize the minimum distance between any pair
    of distinct elements in the selected subset of a dataset, the MaxSum algorithm aims to maximize
    the sum of distances between all pairs of elements in the selected subset. When presented with
    a dataset of samples, the initial point is chosen as the datasetâ€™s medoid center. Next, 
    the second point is chosen to be that which is furthest from this initial point. 
    Subsequently, all following points are selected via the following logic:

    1. Determine the sum of distances from every point to the already-selected ones.
    2. Select the point which has the maximum sum of distances among those calculated in the previous step.

    In the current implementation, this method requires or computes the full pairwise-distance
    matrix, so it is not recommended for large datasets.
